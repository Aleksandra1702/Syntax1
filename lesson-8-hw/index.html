<h3>Subjects of study</h3>
<p>
    At the Awesome Science Faculty, we have a pretty open-minded 
    research facility &mdash; 
    as long as the Subjects fall somewhere in the realm of science
    and technology. You seem like an intelligent, dedicated
    researcher, and just the kind of person we'd like to have on
    our team. Saying that, of the ideas you submitted we were most
    intrigued by are as follows, in order of priority:
</p>
<ol>
  <li>
     Turning H<sub>2</sub>O into wine, and the health benefits 
    of Resveratol(C<sub>14</sub>H<sub>12</sub>O<sub>3</sub>.)
   </li> 
   <li>
      Measuring the effect on perfomance of funk bassplayers at
      tempratures exceeding  30&ordm;C (86&ordm;F), when the audience
      size explonentially increases (effect of 3x10<sup>3</sup>&gt;3x10<sup>4</sup>.)  
    </li>

    <li>
      <abbr title="HyperText Markup Language"> HTML </abbr> and 
      <abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets"> CCS </abbr>constructs 
      for representing musical scores.
    </li>
</ol>
<p>
    So please can you provide more information on each of these
    subjects, including how long you'd expect the research 
    to take, required staff and other resources, and anything else 
    you think we'd need to know?
    Thanks.
</p><h3>Exotic dance moves</h3>
<p> 
    Yes, you are right! As part of my 
    post-doctorate work, I <em>did</em> study tribal dance.
    To answer your question my favorite dances are 
    as follows, with defenitions:
</p>
<dt>
    Polynesian chiken dance
<dd>
    A little know but <em>very</em> influential dance dating 
    back as 300 <abbr title="Before Christ">BC</abbr> a whole
    village would dance around in a cricle like chikens,
    to encourage their livestock or be "fruitful".  
</dd>
    Icelandic brownian shuffle
<dd>
     Before the Icelanders developed fire as a means of getting
     warm, they used to practice this dance, which involve
     hudding close  together in a circle on the floor, and shuffing
     their bodies around in imperceptablytiny, very rapid movements. 
     One of my fellow students used to say that he thought this dance
     inspired modern styles sush as Twerking.
</dd>
        Arctic robot dance
 <dd>
     An interesting example of historic  misinformation, English exploers
     in the 1960sbelived to have discovered a new dance style characterised
     by "robotic", stilted movements,beign practiced by inhabitans of
     Northen Alaska and Canada. Later on howereer it was  discivered, 
     a new dance characterised by "nobotick", stiledstilted movements, 
     movements, beign practiced byinhabitants of Nothern Alaska and Canada.
     Later on however it was discovered that they were just moving like 
     this because they were really cold.
